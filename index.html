         <h1>FAITH CAN DO MIRACLES</h1>
         <h2>A  Parable  from  Swami  Ramtheerth</h2>
         <article>
            <p>
               A learned  scholar  of  the  village  was  holding  a  discourse  from  the  verandah  of  his  house.There  was  a  large  gathering  intently  listening  to  his  speech.  The  theme  was  the  Omkaramanthra. &quot;If you keep on chanting Aum with implicit faith, you can even perform miracles. Why,crossing a river will be just child&apos;s play! Go on chanting aum and you’ll be able even to walk onwater!&quot; He paused for a few moments to look at the faces of the people in the congregation. Theywere looking at each other in wonderment.
            </p>
            <p>
               A group of milkmaids from the adjacent village, returning after selling buttermilk, happened tohear what he said about aum. They did not stop by to listen to the rest of the speech, but moved awayas they were in a hurry to get back home. However, they decided that they would not take a boat tocross the river, but try walking on the water chanting aum. When they reached the river, they keptchanting aloud the aum manthra, and just walked! Though illiterate, they had such faith in what theyheard from the scholar that they confidently walked on the water. As they proceeded towards theirvillage, they were only thinking of the money they had saved by avoiding a boat journey. The next day,they did not take a boat either way and crossed the river, walking on the water chanting aum.

               This  went  on  for  the  next  few  days  and  their  faith  in  the  miracle  of  aum only  increased.  Themilkmaids were happy that they could save some money which they could otherwise spend for theirfamily. They decided that they should collectively entertain the scholar to express their gratitude. Oneday, on their way back, they met the scholar and invited him to their home. They did not tell him aboutthe miracle they had experienced. They said one of them would escort him to their village.

               Later,  when  the  scholar  and  milkmaid  reached  the  river,  he  said,  “Let’s  take  a  boat.”  Themilkmaid said, “No need for a boat, sir, we shall chant &apos;aum&apos; and walk on the water.” While thescholar  hesitated,  the  milkmaid  confidently  started  chanting  aum and  walked  on  the  river.  Thescholar called a villagers and asked him to bring a long rope. He tied it around his waist and,asking two villagers to hold the other end, and pull him out to safety if he were to see him sinkinghe stepped on the water. He was about to sink when he was saved.

               The person who preached others about the power of Omkara did not have any faith in what hepreached, while the simple milkmaids, who had merely followed his advice were benefited.
